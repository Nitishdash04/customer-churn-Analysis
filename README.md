# Customer Churn Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze patterns and trends that can help predict customer churn, enabling better decision-making to reduce churn rates.

## Overview
Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. In this project, we aim to:
1. Understand the factors that contribute to customer churn.
2. Identify patterns in the customer base that correlate with churn.
3. Visualize these insights through various plots and statistical techniques.

### Key Insights:
- **Demographics**: How customer age, gender, and location influence churn.
- **Subscription Plans**: How subscription types, contract terms, and payment methods relate to churn.
- **Customer Support**: The role of customer service calls and support tickets in predicting churn.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Usage data, billing, and payment history are explored for trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is hypothetical or sourced from online repositories such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Ensure that you have the correct dataset for this analysis, typically containing customer information, subscription details, and churn status.

**Dataset Features**:
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID for each customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- `Plan`: Subscription plan of the customer (e.g., monthly, annual).
- `Charges`: Monthly charges.
- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes/No).

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries listed below.

### Required Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyterlab (optional for notebook support)

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## EDA Process
The Exploratory Data Analysis involves:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, formatting dates, and correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing central tendencies, variance, and distribution of variables.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between churn and other variables.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using plots such as histograms, bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps, and pair plots to uncover trends and relationships.

Example of EDA steps:
```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/churn_dataset.csv')

# Visualize churn distribution
sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
plt.show()
```

## Results
Key findings from the EDA:
- **High Monthly Charges**: Customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more.
- **Short Tenure**: Customers who have been with the company for a shorter time are more likely to churn.
- **Contract Type**: Customers on month-to-month contracts churn at a significantly higher rate than those on longer-term contracts.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive EDA and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For potential machine learning applications in predicting churn (if extended).
